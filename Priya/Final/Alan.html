            <h3>1. Mercury-Redstone 3 Mission</h3>
            <p>Alan Shepard's historic flight on May 5, 1961, aboard the Freedom 7 spacecraft marked the first time an American ventured into space.</p>
            <div class="hidden-content" id="fact1">
              <p>The Mercury-Redstone 3 mission was part of Project Mercury, the United States' first human spaceflight program. Shepard's suborbital flight lasted just 15 minutes but was a significant milestone in the Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>

            <h3>2. Suborbital Flight</h3>
            <p>During his Mercury-Redstone 3 mission, Shepard's spacecraft reached a maximum altitude of approximately 187 kilometers (116 miles) above Earth's surface.</p>
            <div class="hidden-content" id="fact2">
              <p>While his flight did not achieve orbit, it provided valuable data on the effects of space travel on the human body and demonstrated the United States' capability to send astronauts into space.</p>

            <p>Alan Shepard was one of the original Mercury Seven astronauts selected by NASA in 1959.</p>
            <div class="hidden-content" id="fact3">
              <p>The Mercury Seven, also known as the Original Seven, were a group of military test pilots chosen for their exceptional flying skills, physical fitness, and courage. Shepard's selection as one of the first astronauts laid the foundation for his historic spaceflight achievements.</p>
