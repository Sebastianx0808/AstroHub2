          <h3>1. First Moonwalker</h3>
          <p>Neil Armstrong was the first human to walk on the moon during the NASA Apollo 11 mission on 20th July 1969...</p>
          <div class="hidden-content" id="fact1">
            <p>He made history by taking that "one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."</p>

          <h3>2. Early Interest in Aviation</h3>
          <p>When Neil was a child, he loved learning about aeroplanes and space...</p>
          <div class="hidden-content" id="fact2">
            <p>His early interest paved the way for his remarkable journey into space exploration.</p>

          <h3>3. Moon Landing Broadcast</h3>
          <p>Around the world, more than half a billion people watched the Moon Landing. When Neil stepped foot on the moon for the first time, he said the now famous line, “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.” Neil walked a distance of about 60 meters on the surface of the moon — that’s roughly the length of 11 Asian elephants!</p>
          <div class="hidden-content" id="fact3">
            <p>The broadcast captured the imaginations of people globally and marked a historic moment.</p>

          <h3>4. Saturn V Rocket</h3>
          <p>The rocket that launched Neil and his crew into space – the Saturn V rocket – was as tall as a 36-storey building! The Launch Control Center was situated 3.5 miles from the launch pad itself. Neil and his crew talked to the U.S. president at the time, Richard Nixon, on their return from the Apollo 11 mission.</p>
          <div class="hidden-content" id="fact4">
            <p>The powerful Saturn V rocket propelled them towards their historic destination.</p>

          <h3>5. The Eagle Has Landed</h3>
          <p>The Lunar Module that Neil and Buzz piloted together to land on the moon was called the Eagle. It’s where the now famous saying, “The Eagle has landed”, comes from!</p>
          <div class="hidden-content" id="fact5">
            <p>The successful landing marked a significant achievement in space exploration.</p>

          <h3>6. View from the Moon</h3>
          <p>Not only were Neil and Buzz the first humans to step foot on the moon, but they were also the first humans to view Earth from the moon’s surface. Neil said that while there, he could hold up his thumb and block out the Earth!</p>
          <div class="hidden-content" id="fact6">
            <p>Observing Earth from the moon offered a unique perspective on our home planet.</p>

          <h3>7. Moon Dust Collectors</h3>
          <p>When Neil and Buzz were on the moon, they collected dust materials from the moon’s surface to study back on Earth. In 2017, the samples were sold at auction for £1.4 million — wow!</p>
          <div class="hidden-content" id="fact7">
            <p>The moon dust samples became valuable artifacts for scientific research and collectors.</p>

          <h3>8. Reluctant Hero</h3>
          <p>Neil was considered a great American hero, but a reluctant hero, too. After the Apollo 11 Mission, Neil only stayed with NASA for a further two years. He found the press attention exhausting and decided that he wanted to be a teacher of engineering in his home state of Ohio.</p>
          <div class="hidden-content" id="fact8">
            <p>Despite fame, Neil chose a quieter life away from the spotlight.</p>
